# Telegram Project Analyzer Bot

## About
This Python-based bot is designed to analyze Telegram projects, extracting key information such as smart contract addresses and links to social networks. It demonstrates the ability to interact with Telegram bots, parse structured data, and extract relevant information for further analysis.

## Features
- Connects to a specified Telegram bot
- Extracts smart contract addresses from bot messages
- Identifies and collects links to various social networks (Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, Discord)
- Provides a structured output of extracted information
- Handles potential errors and edge cases in data extraction

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- python-telegram-bot library for Telegram bot interaction
- Regular expressions for pattern matching and data extraction

## How It Works
1. The script establishes a connection with the specified Telegram bot.
2. It retrieves messages from the bot.
3. Each message is parsed to extract:
   - Smart contract addresses
   - Links to social networks
4. The extracted information is structured and presented in an easily readable format.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Telegram Bot Token (for the bot you're analyzing)

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install python-telegram-bot
3. Set up your Telegram Bot Token in the script
4. Run the script:
     python telegram_project_analyzer.py

## Configuration
Update the `TOKEN` variable in the script with your Telegram Bot Token:
```python
TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'

## Sample Output
Bot Name: Project Analyzer
Bot Username: @project_analyzer_bot

Smart Contract: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
